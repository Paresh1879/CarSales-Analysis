# Electric Car Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing electric car sales data, with a focus on the state of Washington.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:** Fetches electric car sales data from a provided URL, conducts basic data cleaning, and adds a generic ID column.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes top values for selected columns and explores relationships between multiple columns.
- **Modeling:** Provides functions for modeling tasks such as linear regression and logistic regression, though actual model implementation is not included.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `uszipcode`
- `sklearn`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `numpy`

You can install them using pip or conda.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the provided code and explore the electric car sales data.
3. Modify or extend the functions as needed for your analysis requirements.

## Data Source

The electric car sales data is retrieved from a provided URL. It includes information such as make, model, electric range, and base MSRP.


## Future Improvements

- Implement modeling tasks and evaluate different models' performance.
- Expand the analysis to include more insights and findings from the electric car sales data.
- Incorporate additional data sources or features to enhance the analysis.
- Enhance code readability and maintainability by adding more detailed comments and documentation.
